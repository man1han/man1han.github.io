            "concept" : "\"UPLY\" (pronounced you-ply) uses AR-Core library and Flutter (a cross-platform framework bu Google) to render user profile and job openings using Augmented Reality. UPLY could be used to learn more about sponsors and have a meaningful conversation when you get an opportunity to talk to them.",
            "challenges" : "One of the most challenging thing we faced was integrating ArCore with Flutter and displaying augmented images on a screen. Another challenge was to work with the iCIMS API as it was not yet completely functional.",
