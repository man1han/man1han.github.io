So, what better way to kick off my blog than with the story of how I got into coding and why I still love it?" },

            { "type": "text", "data": "It all started with Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green on my Game Boy Advance. While most kids were busy just enjoying the game, all I could think about was—how was this even made? The way the characters moved, the turn-based battles, the pixel-perfect world—it fascinated me. That was the first time I started wondering what went on behind the scenes of a video game." },

            { "type": "text", "data": "At the age of seven, I got my first laptop, and naturally, I filled it with games. But more than that, it opened the gateway to the internet. Suddenly, I could look up how these games were created, what game development companies did, and what kind of tools they used. At that age, I probably didn’t understand much, but I remember learning about game engines, programming languages, and how developers designed entire worlds from scratch. Since coding was a little out of my reach at the time, I started experimenting with art. I figured that if I could develop my design skills, it could help me get into the creative side of game development, even if I wasn’t yet ready to dive into the programming side." },

GTA and Bully felt so immersive—how could such detailed, real-world-like experiences fit inside a single DVD? I loved that I could create my own stories within these games. That idea stuck with me: the power of software to build entire universes." },

The deeper I got into programming, the more I realized just how vast the field was. At first, it was overwhelming, but I learned to take smaller steps and make it manageable—just like debugging code, one error at a time." },

But what fascinated me the most wasn’t the suit—it was J.A.R.V.I.S. The idea of an AI that could understand and assist in such a natural way blew my mind. That was the moment I realized that computer science wasn’t just about making games; it was a field that could let me explore all the technologies I was passionate about." },

Now, I was diving into the real stuff: algorithms used in robotics, motion planning, decision-making, and more. But there was a catch—a huge amount of math. I quickly realized that if I wanted to get to the fun parts, I had to power through the equations and theory. Fortunately, most of it was interesting because I knew that mastering it would allow me to build things that once seemed like science fiction. " },

Whether it's AI, game development, or something entirely new, I know I have the skills to create, innovate, and push my limits." },
